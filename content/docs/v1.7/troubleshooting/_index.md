# Troubleshooting

When you have any problems with the Vald cluster, e.g., deployment, API, etc., this page will help resolve them.

## Flow chart

The [flow chart](/docs/v1.7/troubleshooting/flow-chart) explains the Vald cluster troubleshooting flow for users and operators of the Vald cluster.

It mainly targets the deployment view, but it will help when users get the error as an API response, and the error is not due to the client-side.

## Operation troubleshooting

The [operation troubleshooting](/docs/v1.7/troubleshooting/operation-troubleshooting) shows the popular troubleshooting for users of the Vald cluster.

It lists the prevalent troubles when getting a response from the Vald cluster.
It would be better to refer to the [API status](/docs/v1.7/api/status) page at the same time to understand the meaning of the error code.
